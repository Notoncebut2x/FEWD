##  Git

A version control program that saves the state of your project's files and folders; basically, it takes a "snapshot" of what all your files look like at a moment and stores a reference to that "snapshot."

--

### Repository

A central location in which data - typically about a project - is stored and managed.

--

### Clone

Download data from the cloud to your local machine (laptop, computer, etc.).

--

### Commit

Save a version of your project to git.

--
### Why is GitHub Valuable? Why do developers use GitHub?

*	Since GitHub stores a history of the code, it allows developers to go back in time if something breaks.
*	GitHub allows multiple developers to work on the same project. Much like Dropbox or Google Drive lets multiple people collaborate on the same document, GitHub allows this for code.
*	GitHub tracks changes so you can see who worked on what.
*	GitHub allows for feedback to be given on the code, which hopefully, increases code quality. Much like an editor updates a Word document using Track Changes, GitHub allows a similar environment.

---
## Let's Set Up Our Repositories! 

[Download the GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/)

---
## How will we use GitHub?

*	As a tool to submit assignments and download files.
*	To review work/assignments and provide feedback.

--

##Submitting Homework

*	Upload completed homework in a 'final' folder in your repo.
*	Use the homework submission form to turn it in.
*	We will provide comments and feedback directly to your code.
*	In addition to code review, assignments will be graded on a rubric using a scale of exceeds/meets/does not meet expectations for technical requirements.

## What do front-end developers do?

--
## Client-Side Development

The client is the application the end-user runs to use your website. In most cases, a web browser such as Chrome or Firefox.

Languages include:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

Note:
Front-end is all about keeping the 'everywhere' in mind, and making the best
experience possible in every context.

##HTML vs HTML5

HTML5 is HTML with a few additions.
The Doctype tells you if the page is HTML5 ready.


```<!DOCTYPE html>```
